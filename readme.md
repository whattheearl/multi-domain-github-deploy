# A github pages test project
seems to be inteded for simple static site deployment with a single domain

## Limitations
- static routing to build artifacts or  branch folder
- single cname but can have wild cards

## Issues
- if you want to host multiple static sites they would need to live in subroutes
- it is not possible to seperate deployments
